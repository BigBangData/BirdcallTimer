## Background

My partner needed a customizable timer for sitting and standing while doing her computer work at a stand-up desk. 

She's also a bird-watching geek.

I created a simple timer that randomly draws from a collection of birdcalls and plays one, while also displaying some information about that bird and its picture. This will help my partner memorize which birdcalls are associated with which birds.

My partner discovered with triumphant glee that by using this timer to both regulate her sit-stand routine **and** learn birdcalls, she will have "killed two birds with one stone"...

## Demo

A brief demo of the timer with dummy (fast) times - unfortunately, it misses the main feature: the birdcall!

## Acknowledgments

I'm indebted to the **xeno-canto project** ([www.xeno-canto.org](https://www.xeno-canto.org/)) and the [Macaulay Library](https://macaulaylibrary.org/) at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home) for their impressive collections of bird sounds and pictures, respectively.

I downloaded bird recordings and recording metadata from the Kaggle machine-learning competition [Cornell Birdcall Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition). Bird pictures and picture metadata were manually obtained from the Macaulay Library.
