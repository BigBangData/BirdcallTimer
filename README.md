## Background

My partner needed a customizable timer for sitting and standing while doing her computer work at a stand-up desk. 

She's also a bird-watching geek.

I created a simple timer that randomly draws from a collection of birdcalls and plays one, while also displaying some information about that bird and its picture. This will help my partner memorize which birdcalls are associated with which birds.

*DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for any brain damage associated with the following logic and/or joke.*

My best half discovered with triumphant glee that by hearing the birdcall **and** seeing the bird, she will have "killed two birds with one stone" - a magical metaphor my brain has yet to fully comprehend.
